   The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&P 500, is a stock market index that tracks 500 large companies
   listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices. 
   As of December 31st, 2020, more than $4.6 trillion was invested in assets tied to the performance of the index.

   The S&P 500 index is a free-float weighted/capitalization-weighted index and the 10 largest companies in the index
   account for 26.4% of the market capitalization of the index. The 10 largest companies in the index, in order of weighting,
   are Apple Inc., Microsoft, Amazon.com, Facebook, Alphabet Inc. (class A & C), Tesla, Inc., Berkshire Hathaway, 
   JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Johnson & Johnson. Although the index includes only companies listed in the United States, 
   companies in the index derive on average only 72% of their revenue in the United States.

   The index value is updated every 15 seconds, or 1,559 times per trading day, with price updates disseminated by Reuters.

   The S&P 500 is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, a joint venture majority-owned by S&P Global, and its components are
   selected by a committee.

   Requirements to be added to the index include:

   1. Market capitalization must be greater than or equal to $13.1 billion.
   2. Annual dollar value traded to float-adjusted market capitalization is greater than 1.0.
   3. Minimum monthly trading volume of 250,000 shares in each of the six months leading up to the evaluation date.
   4. Must be publicly listed on either the New York Stock Exchange (including NYSE Arca or NYSE American) or 
      NASDAQ (NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Select Market or the NASDAQ Capital Market).
   5. The company should be from the U.S.
   6. Securities that are ineligible for inclusion in the index are limited partnerships, master limited partnerships 
      and their investment trust units, OTC Bulletin Board issues, closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds, Exchange-traded notes,
      royalty trusts, tracking stocks, preferred stock, unit trusts, equity warrants, convertible bonds, investment trusts, 
      American depositary receipts, and American depositary shares.

   To remain indicative of the largest public companies in the United States, the index is reconstituted quarterly; however, 
   efforts are made to minimize turnover in the index as a result of declines in value of constituent companies.
